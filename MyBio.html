            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I started working at 16 years old with my brother helping him ouit on the job. We installed self serve
                drink machines like you see at
                most fast food restaruants. I found myself more interested in cars at the time so I dedcided that was
                what I wanted to do so once I graduated
                from high school I took classes at Eastfield community college to become an automotive technician.
                Unfortunatly during second semester I
                got evicted and my car motor blew around same time. So I had to pull out of class and I spent several
                years trying to get back into school
                this time for engineering. This led me to computer programming and coding. Which for me was like a
                breath of fresh air since I've done nothing
                but manual labor jobs through my work career and I really loved it so i took a boot camp to get into the
                industry ASAP. I do plan on finshing
                a bachelor degree associated to this field not because I need to just because I enjoy learning.
